<h1 class="heading"><span class="name">Creating GUI Objects</span></h1>

GUI objects are represented by .NET classes in the .NET Namespace `System.Windows.Forms`. In general, these classes correspond closely to the GUI objects provided by Dyalog, which are themselves based upon the Windows API.

For example, to create a form containing a button and an edit field, you would create instances of the `Form`, `Button` and `TextBox` classes.
