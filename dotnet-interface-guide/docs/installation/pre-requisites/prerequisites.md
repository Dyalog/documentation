# Pre-requisites

See Microsoft's .NET webpages ([https://dotnet.microsoft.com/](https://dotnet.microsoft.com/)) for information on whether the version of macOS/Linux/Microsoft Windows that you are running supports .NET.

.NET is not available for IBM AIX and is not supported on the Raspberry Pi models Zero, 1 or 2. 

The Dyalog version  .NET interface requires .NET version 8.0 or later – it does not work with earlier versions of .NET.

The .NET interface only works with the Unicode edition of Dyalog; the Classic edition is not supported.

Once .NET has been successfully installed (see [Section 1.0.1](installing-dotnet.md)) no further installation is required to use the Dyalog .NET interface.

Exporting APL code to .NET assemblies is only supported on 64-bit versions of Dyalog.
