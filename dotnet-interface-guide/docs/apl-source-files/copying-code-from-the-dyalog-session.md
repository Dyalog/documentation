# Copying Code from the Dyalog  Session

You might find it easy to write APL code using the Dyalog Session's function/class editor, or you might already have code in a workspace that you want to copy into an APL Source file. In either case, you can transfer code from the Session into an appropriate text editor using the clipboard.

When pasting APL code from the Session into a text editor, line numbers can be included; although this is allowed, it is not recommended in APL Source files.
