<h1 class="heading"><span class="name">Component Files</span></h1>

A component file is a data file maintained by Dyalog APL.  It contains a series of APL arrays known as components which are accessed by reference to their relative positions or component number within the file.  A set of system functions is provided to perform a range of file operations. (See [Component Files](../../../language-reference-guide/system-functions/system-functions-by-category#component-files).) These provide facilities to create or delete files, and to read and write components.  Facilities are also provided for multi-user access including the capability to determine who may do what, and file locking for concurrent updates. (See the *Dyalog Programming Reference Guide*).
