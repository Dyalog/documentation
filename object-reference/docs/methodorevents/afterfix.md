<h1 class="heading"><span class="name">AfterFix</span> <span class="right">Event 822</span></h1>



**Applies To:** [Editor](../../../windows-ui-guide/the-session-object/session-object)

**Description**


If enabled, this event is reported immediately after the Editor has successfully fixed a new object, or a new version of an object, in the workspace.


You may not nullify or modify the event with a 0-returning callback, nor may you generate the event using `⎕NQ`, or call it as a method. However, returning 0 from a callback will cause the Edit window to remain open if the user action was Fix and Exit (EP).


The event message reported as the result of `⎕DQ`, or supplied as the right argument to your callback function, is a 7-element vector as follows :


|-----|---------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
|`[1]`|Object   |ref to the Editor object                                                                                         |
|`[2]`|Event    |`'AfterFix'` or 822                                                                                              |
