**Applies To:** [Editor](../../../windows-ui-guide/the-session-object/session-object)

**Description**


If enabled, this event is reported when the user attempts to format an object in the Editor window.


If the callback function returns 0, the contents of the Edit window are not reformatted.


You may not generate the event using `⎕NQ`, or call it as a method.


The event message reported as the result of `⎕DQ`, or supplied as the right argument to your callback function, is a 6-element vector as follows :
