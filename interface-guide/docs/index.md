# About

The _Dyalog for Microsoft Windows Interfaces Guide_ describes various interfaces between Dyalog and Microsoft Windows, including the Multiple Document Interface (MDI) and docking, the Component Object Model (COM) interface, and other Microsoft Windows applications. It also describes the underlying concepts, implementation rules, and graphical resources available when creating a user interface using Dyalog.

This document should be read in conjunction with the [_Dyalog for Microsoft Windows Object Reference Guide_](../object-reference/).
