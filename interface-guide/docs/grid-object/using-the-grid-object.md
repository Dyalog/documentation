<h1 class="heading"><span class="name">Using the Grid Object</span></h1>

The Grid object allows you to display information in a series of rows and columns and lets the user input and change the data. The Grid has four main components; a matrix of cells that represents the data, a set of row titles, a set of column titles, and a pair of scroll bars. The following picture illustrates these components. The scroll bars scroll the data cells and either the row or column titles. The row titles remain fixed in place when the data cells scroll horizontally and the column titles stay fixed when the data is scrolled vertically.
