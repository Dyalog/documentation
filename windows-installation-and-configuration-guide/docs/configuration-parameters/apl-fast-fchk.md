# APL_FAST_FCHK

This parameter specifies whether Dyalog APL should optimise `⎕FCHK` by allowing it to reliably determine whether a component file had been properly untied and therefore does not need to be checked (this is overridable using the `⎕FCHK` option force).

Optimising `⎕FCHK` in this way has a performance impact on `⎕FUNTIE` and it is recommended this optimisation is switched off if your application frequently ties and unties files.

Note: this only affects component files with journaling enabled.

The values of the parameter are:

|---|----------------------------------------------------|
|0  |Do not optimise `⎕FCHK` (optimise `⎕FUNTIE` instead)|
|1  |Optimise `⎕FCHK`                                    |

The default value of the parameter is 0 on all platforms. On Windows, setting the value 1 has no effect.
