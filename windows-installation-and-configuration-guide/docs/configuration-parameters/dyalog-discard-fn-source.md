<h1 class="heading"><span class="name">DYALOG_DISCARD_FN_SOURCE</span></h1>

This Boolean parameter specifies whether (1) or not (0) source code is discarded from the workspace when an object is fixed. The default value is 0 which means that source code is retained in the workspace and will subsequently be presented for editing as it had been saved previously.

For further information, see [Discard Source Information](../../../language-reference-guide/primitive-operators/i-beam/discard-source-information) and [Source as Typed](../../../earlier-release-notes/release-notes-v19-0/introduction/source-as-typed).
