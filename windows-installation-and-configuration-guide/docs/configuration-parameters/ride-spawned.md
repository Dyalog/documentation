<h1 class="heading"><span class="name">Ride_Spawned</span></h1>

If non-zero, this parameter disables `âŽ•SR` and `)SH` which instead generate `DOMAIN ERROR`. This parameter is used to prevent certain user-interfaces from being executed from a Ride session which does not support them, and which would otherwise cause the Ride session to become unresponsive. See [Ride User Guide](https://dyalog.github.io/ride).
