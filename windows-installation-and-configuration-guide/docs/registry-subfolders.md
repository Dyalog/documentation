<h1 class="heading"><span class="name">Registry Sub-Folders</span></h1>

A large amount of configuration information is maintained in the Windows Registry in sub-folders of the main folder identified by **inifile**.

Many of these values are dynamic, for example the position of the various Session windows, is maintained in a Registry sub-folder so that their appearance is maintained from one invocation of APL to the next. These types of Registry values are considered to be internal and are therefore not described herein.

However, any Registry Value that is maintained via a configuration dialog box will be named and described in the documentation for that dialog box in Chapter 2.
