!!! Warning "Warning"
	The `⎕PROFILE` system function can collect very large quantities of data. This means that, to profile a large application or to save a dataset as an XML file, the workspace size might need to be increased significantly.

For complete documentation of the `⎕PROFILE` system function, see the Dyalog APL Language Reference Guide.
