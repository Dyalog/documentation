# About This Document

This document covers the installation procedure and configuration options for Dyalog on a Unix-based platform. It details the environment variables that can be used to customise individual instances, the requirements for using the PuTTY terminal emulator, and the upgrade and uninstall procedures.

It is assumed that the reader has a basic knowledge of UNIX and software terminology; a working knowledge of Dyalog is useful but not essential.
