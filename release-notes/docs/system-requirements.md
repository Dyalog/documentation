This page describes the hardware and software requirements for Dyalog v20.0. 

## Supported Dyalog Versions

Current version: Dyalog v20.0  
Previous supported versions: Dyalog v19.0 and v18.2  

Dyalog version 18.0 (and earlier versions) are no longer supported.  

### Supported Platforms
Dyalog v20.0 is supported on the following platforms/operating systems:  

* IBM AIX:
    * AIX 7.2 SP2 TL2 onwards with a POWER9 chip or higher
* Linux:
    * x86_64: Built on Ubuntu 20.04
    * ARM64: Built on Debian GNU/Linux 12
* macOS:
    * Apple M1 or later (ARM-based only): macOS 13.4.1 (Ventura) onwards
* Microsoft Windows:
    * Windows 10 onwards (Windows Server 2016 onwards)
* Raspberry Pi (ARM-based): 
    * 32-bit: Raspberry Pi OS Buster or later  
    NOTE: Does not run on a 64-bit operating system
    * 64-bit: Raspberry Pi OS Bookworm or later  
    NOTE: Installed using the Linux ARM64 package
    * Not supported on Raspberry Pi Pico
## External .NET Requirements
### .NET Interface
The .NET interface requires version 8.0 of Microsoft .NET or higher.
### Microsoft .NET Framework
The .NET Framework interface requires version 4.0 or greater of Microsoft .NET Framework. It does not operate with earlier versions of the .NET Framework. In addition:  

* Microsoft .NET Framework version 4.5 is needed for full data binding support.  
Note: This includes support for the <code class="language-other">INotifyCollectionChanged</code> interface, which is used by Dyalog to notify a data consumer when the contents of a variable that is data bound as a list of items changes.  

* IIS (and ASP.NET) need to be installed before installing Dyalog. If these are not present when Dyalog is installed, the **[DYALOG]\Samples\asp.net** directory will not be installed.
### Chromium Embedded Framework (CEF)
Dyalog version 20.0 is supplied with CEF version 121 on all supported platforms.
### HTMLRenderer
The HTMLRenderer is supported on the following platforms:  

* Linux (x86_64 only)
* macOS
* Microsoft Windows  

To see which version of CEF was used when the HTMLRenderer was built, query the `CEFVersion` property of an instance of the HTMLRenderer:
```apl
      'hr' ⎕WC 'HTMLRenderer'
      hr.CEFVersion[2 3]      ⍝ CEF major version and commit number
121 3
```
### Auxiliary Processors
If the configuration parameter `ENABLE_CEF` is `1`, Auxiliary Processors cannot be used (they hang on error). By default, `ENABLE_CEF` is `1` (unless you are not running under a desktop, for example, you are running Dyalog in a PuTTY session; in this case the default is `0`).
