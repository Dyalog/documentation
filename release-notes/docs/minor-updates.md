# Minor Updates and Bug Fixes

This page describes minor updates and bug fixes included in Dyalog v20.0.

Coming soon...

[`âŽ•FX`](../../language-reference-guide/system-functions/fx/)  
The rules around whether a syntactically-invalid function can be fixed have been tightened to prevent functions with unmatched parentheses from being fixed.

[`)SAVE`](../../language-reference-guide/system-commands/save/)  
On platforms other than Microsoft Windows, you can no longer overwrite a workspace that was saved with an earlier version of Dyalog without using the `-force` option.
