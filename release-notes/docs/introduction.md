# Introduction

This document describes the requirements for installing Dyalog v20.0 and the functionality changes in Dyalog v20.0 compared with Dyalog v19.0.

!!! Info "Information"  
    If you are upgrading from Dyalog v18.2 or earlier to Dyalog v20.0, you are advised to read the Release Notes for any intermediate versions in conjunction with this document.
	
## Release Highlights

Key enhancements in Dyalog v20.0 include the following:
 
- Array notation, a literal syntax for most arrays (including nested and high-rank arrays) and namespaces, has been introduced. Array notation allows you to write literal arrays in a way that was not possible before.
- Namespace manipulation and data extraction has been made easier with the addition of `⎕VGET` and `⎕VSET`, and extensions to `⎕NS`. These changes are particularly useful when dealing with namespaces generated by applying `⎕JSON` to JSON requests from webservices, as default values can be specified to mitigate the effects of missing members.
- The two common patterns `(f Y) g Y` and `(f X) g Y` can now be represented by the new compositional operator _behind_ ( `⍛` ).
- `⎕SHELL` enables execution of external programs with more control and options than those provided by `⎕SH`/`⎕CMD`.
- Expressions can now be evaluated primitive-by-primitive using inline tracing, while accessing arguments and results of each function along the way.

For more information on these and other changes introduced in Dyalog v20.0, see [New and Enhanced Features](../new-enhanced/).

!!! Info "Information"

Changes to tools are not included within these Release Notes.
