!!! Info "Information"  
    If you are upgrading from Dyalog v18.2 or earlier to Dyalog v20.0, you should read the Release Notes for any intermediate versions in conjunction with this document.
	
## Release Highlights

Key enhancements introduced in Dyalog v20.0 include the following:
 
- Array notation, a literal syntax for most arrays (including nested and high-rank arrays) and namespaces, has been introduced. With array notation, arrays can be entered and displayed over multiple lines.
- Namespace manipulation and data extraction has been made easier with the addition of `⎕VGET` and `⎕VSET`, and extensions to `⎕NS`. These changes are particularly useful when dealing with namespaces generated by applying `⎕JSON` to JSON requests from webservices, as default values an be specified to mitigate the effects of missing members.
- The two common patterns `(f Y) g Y` and `(f X) g Y` can now be represented by the new compositional operator _behind_ (`⍛`).
- `⎕SHELL` enables execution of external programs with more control and options than those provided by `⎕SH`/`⎕CMD`.
- Expressions can now be evaluated primitive-by-primitive using inline tracing, while accessing arguments and results of each function along the way.
