### External .NET Requirements
#### .NET Interface
The .NET interface requires version 8.0 of Microsoft .NET or higher.
#### Microsoft .NET Framework
The .NET Framework interface requires version 4.0 or greater of Microsoft .NET Framework. It does not operate with earlier versions of the .NET Framework. In addition:  

* Microsoft .NET Framework version 4.5 is needed for full data binding support.  
Note: This includes support for the <code class="language-other">INotifyCollectionChanged</code> interface, which is used by Dyalog to notify a data consumer when the contents of a variable that is data bound as a list of items changes.  

* IIS (and ASP.NET) need to be installed before installing Dyalog. If these are not present when Dyalog is installed, the **[DYALOG]\Samples\asp.net** directory will not be installed.
### Chromium Embedded Framework (CEF)
Dyalog version 20.0 is supplied with CEF version 121 on all supported platforms.
#### HTMLRenderer
The HTMLRenderer is supported on the following platforms:  

* Linux (x86_64 only)
* macOS
* Microsoft Windows  

To see which version of CEF was used when the HTMLRenderer was built, query the `CEFVersion` property of an instance of the HTMLRenderer:
```apl
      'hr' ⎕WC 'HTMLRenderer'
      hr.CEFVersion[2 3]      ⍝ CEF major version and commit number
121 3
```
#### Auxiliary Processors
If the configuration parameter `ENABLE_CEF` is `1`, Auxiliary Processors cannot be used (they hang on error). By default, `ENABLE_CEF` is `1` (unless you are not running under a desktop, for example, you are running Dyalog in a PuTTY session; in this case the default is `0`).
