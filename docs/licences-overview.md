<h1 class="heading"><span class="name">Licences for third-party components</span></h1>

The software product you have received may include one or more third-party software components. Licence notices for these components are provided in Licences for third-party components.docx in the help subdirectory of the Dyalog installation directory.

Note that if your Dyalog licence permits the distribution of applications built upon Dyalog APL, or the redistribution of Dyalog APL itself, these licence notices must also be redistributed. For your convenience they are supplied as a Word document for use in your own documentation. If you have any concerns about redistributing these third party software products, please contact Dyalog to discuss your options.
