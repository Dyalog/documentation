<h1 class="heading"><span class="name"> The Session Toolbars</span></h1>

The Session toolbars are contained by four separate CoolBand objects, allowing you to configure their order in whichever way you choose. The tool buttons appear differently according to whether or not Native Look and Feel is enabled.

The bitmaps for the buttons displayed on the session tool bar are implemented by three ImageList objects owned by the CoolBar `⎕SE.cbtop`. These represent the ToolButton images in their normal, highlighted and inactive states and are named `iln`, `ilh` and `ili` respectively. These images derive from three bitmap resources contained in `dyalog.exe` named `tb_normal`, `tb_hot` and `tb_inactive`.

If Native Look and Feel is enabled all three bitmap resources are mapped to a different set of images which are capable of  reflecting the *Visual Styles* in use.
