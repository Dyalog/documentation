# <span>Query Monitor</span> `R←⎕MONITOR Y`{{key}}

`Y` must be a simple character scalar or vector which is taken to be the name of a visible defined function or operator.

Note that `⎕MONITOR` does not apply to  dfns or dops.

`R` is a simple non-negative integer matrix of 5 columns with one row for each line in the function or operator `Y` which has the monitor set, giving:

|--------|-------------------------------------|
|Column 1|Line number                          |
|Column 2|Number of times the line was executed|
|Column 3|CPU time in milliseconds             |
|Column 4|Elapsed time in milliseconds         |
|Column 5|Reserved                             |

The value of `0` in column one indicates that the monitor is set on the function or operator as a whole. `R` will be empty for dfns and dops.
