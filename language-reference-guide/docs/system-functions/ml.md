# <span>Migration Level</span> `⎕ML`



`⎕ML` determines the degree of migration of the Dyalog APL language towards IBM's APL2.  Setting this variable to other than its default value of `1` changes the interpretation of certain symbols and language constructs. `⎕ML` has Namespace scope.


|-------|----------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
|`⎕ML←0`|&nbsp;    |Original Native Dyalog                                                                               |
|`⎕ML←1`|`Z←∊R`    |Monadic `'∊'` is interpreted as 'enlist' rather than 'type'.                                         |
|`⎕ML←2`|`Z←↑R`    |Monadic `'↑'` is interpreted as 'first' rather than 'mix'.                                           |
|&nbsp; |`Z←⊃R`    |Monadic `'⊃'` is interpreted as 'mix' rather than 'first'.                                           |
|&nbsp; |`Z←≡R`    |Monadic `'≡'` returns a positive rather than a negative value, if its argument has non-uniform depth.|
|`⎕ML←3`|`R←X⊂[K]Y`|Dyadic `'⊂'` follows the APL2 (rather than the original Dyalog APL) convention.                      |
|&nbsp; |`⎕TC`     |The order of the elements of `⎕TC` is the same as in APL2.                                           |


Subsequent versions of Dyalog APL may provide further migration levels.
