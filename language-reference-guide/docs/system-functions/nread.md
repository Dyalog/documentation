# <span>Native File Read</span> `R←⎕NREAD Y`{{key}}

This monadic function reads data from a native file. `Y` is a 3- or 4-element integer vector whose elements are as follows:

|---|---|
|`[1]`|negative tie number,|
|`[2]`|conversion code (see below),|
|`[3]`|count. If this value is `¯1` , all of the elements defined by `Y[2]` are read from the position specified by `Y[4]` to the end of the file. This may result in the last few bytes in the file being ignored if they do not form a complete element.|
|`[4]`|start byte, counting from 0. If this value omitted or is `¯1` , data is read starting from the current position in the file (initially `0` ).|

## Notes

`8 ⎕NINFO ⊃Y` can be used to report the current position of the file pointer.

`Y[2]` specifies conversion to an APL internal form as follows. Note that the internal formats for character arrays differ between the Unicode and Classic Editions.

If both `Y[3]` and `Y[4]` have the value `¯1`, then `⎕NREAD` reads data from the current position in the file to the end of the file.

`⎕NREAD` can be used with any file. However, calling `⎕NREAD` with at least one of `Y[3 4]` set to `¯1` is intended for regular files only; using on pipes, FIFOs or other special types of file is not recommended.

!!! Legacy "Legacy"
    Conversion code 82 is permitted in the Unicode edition for backwards compatibility purposes and causes 1-byte data on file to be translated (according to [⎕NXLATE](./nxlate.md)) from [⎕AV](./av.md) indices into normal (Unicode) characters of type 80, 160 or 320.

|11   |count               |1 bit Boolean   |8 `×` count |
|82   |count               |8 bits character|count       |
|83   |count               |8 bits integer  |count       |
