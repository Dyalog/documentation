`)ED` invokes the Dyalog editor and opens an Edit window for each of the objects specified in `nms`.


If a name includes the slash character  ("\" or "/") it is taken to be the name of a file. See [Editing Scripts and Text Files](../../../windows-ui-guide/editing-scripts-and-text-files).


If a name is followed by a line number specified in square brackets, the Editor positions the cursor in the corresponding line. There must not be a space between the last character of the name and the "[".


If a name specifies a new symbol it is taken to be a function or operator.  However, if a name is localised in a suspended function or operator but is otherwise undefined, it is assumed to be a vector of character vectors.




The type of a new object may be specified explicitly by preceding its name with an appropriate symbol as follows:


|---|---------------------------|
|`∇`|function or operator       |
|`→`|simple character vector    |
|`∊`|vector of character vectors|
|`-`|character matrix           |
|`⍟`|Namespace script           |
|`○`|Class script               |
|`∘`|Interface                  |
|`⋄`|Array Notation             |



The first object named becomes the top window on the stack.  See the *Dyalog for Microsoft Windows UI Guide* or the *Dyalog for UNIX UI Guide* for details.


<h2 class="example">Examples</h2>
```apl

      )ED MYFUNCTION

      )ED MYFUNCTION[1000] YOURFUNCTION[3]

      )ED ∇FOO -MAT ∊VECVEC

```


Objects specified in `nms` that cannot be edited are silently ignored. Objects qualified with a namespace path  (for example, `a.b.c.foo`) are silently ignored if the namespace does not exist.
