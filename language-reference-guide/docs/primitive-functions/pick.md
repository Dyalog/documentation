# <span>Pick</span> `R←X⊃Y`{{key}}



`Y` may be any array.


`X` is a scalar or vector of indices of `Y`.


`R` is an item selected from the structure of `Y` according to `X`.


Elements of `X` select from successively deeper levels in the structure of `Y`.  The items of `X` are simple integer scalars or vectors which identify a set of indices, one per axis at the particular level of nesting of `Y` in row-major order.  Simple scalar items in `Y` may be picked by empty vector items in `X` to any arbitrary depth.


`⎕IO` is an implicit argument of Pick.
