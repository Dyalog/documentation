<h1 class="heading"><span class="name">Equal To</span> <span class="command">R←X=Y</span></h1>



`Y` may be any array. `X` may be any array. `R` is Boolean.


`⎕CT` and `⎕DCT` are  implicit arguments of Equal To.


If `X` and `Y` are refs, then `R` is 1 if they are refs to the same object. If `X` is a ref and `Y` is not, or vice-versa, then `R` is 0.


If `X` and `Y` are character, then `R` is 1 if they are the same character. If `X` is character and `Y` is numeric, or vice-versa, then `R` is 0.


If `X` and `Y` are numeric, then `R` is 1 if `X` and `Y` are within comparison tolerance of each other.



For real numbers `X` and `Y`, `X` is considered equal to `Y` if `(|X-Y)` is not greater than `⎕CT×(|X)⌈|Y`.


For complex numbers `X=Y` is 1 if the magnitude of `X-Y` does not exceed `⎕CT` times the larger of the magnitudes of `X` and `Y`; geometrically, `X=Y` if the number smaller in magnitude lies on or within a circle centred on the one with larger magnitude, having radius `⎕CT` times the larger magnitude.
